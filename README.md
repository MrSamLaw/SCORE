## What We Did

The entire app has been built over the course of 2 weeks. Back-End Mongo Models were built with future developments in mind, with Graph QL typeDefs, reducers, queries & mutations added to reflect the models. JSON Web Token was also built in to handle user signups & logins.

The Front-End was developed with React & SASS.  
The App is also installable as a Progressive Web App.

SCORE is not 100% fully functional yet, and will continue to be developed.
